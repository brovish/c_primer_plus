Solutions to exercises from the book C Primer Plus by Stephen Prata.
I read this book from about April 2021 to the end of November 2021
I did almost all the tasks myself and I tapped the entire text from the book.

from C Primer Plus 6th Edition:

## C Language Books ##

- Feuer, Alan R. **The C Puzzle Book, Revised Printing**. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Addison-Wesley Professional, 1998.
This book contains many programs whose output you are supposed to predict. Predicting the output gives you a good opportunity to test and expand your understanding of C. The book includes answers and explanations.

- Kernighan, Brian W. and Dennis M. Ritchie. **The C Programming Language, Second Edition** .Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1988.
This is the second edition of the first book on C. (Note that the creator of C, Dennis Ritchie, is one of the authors.) The first edition constituted the definition of “K&R” C, the unofficial standard for many years. This edition incorporates ANSI changes based on the ANSI draft that was standard at the time the book was written. The book includes many interesting examples. It does, however, assume that the reader is familiar with systems programming.
- Koenig, Andrew. **C Traps and Pitfalls**. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1989.
The title says it all. 

- Summit, Steve. **C Programming FAQs** . Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1995.
This is an expanded book version of the Internet FAQ.

## Programming Books ##
- Kernighan, Brian W. and P.J. Plauger. **The Elements of Programming Style, Second Edition**. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1978.
This slim, out-of-print classic draws on examples from other texts to illustrate the do’s and don’ts of clear, effective programming.


- Knuth, Donald E. **The Art of Computer Programming**, Volume 1 (Fundamental Algorithms), Third Edition . Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1997.
This non-slim classic standard reference examines data representation and algorithm analysis in great detail. It is advanced and mathematical in nature. Volume 2 (Seminumerical Algorithms, 1997) includes an extensive discussion of pseudorandom numbers. Volume 3 (Sorting and Searching, 1998), as the name suggests, examines sorting and searching. Examples are given in pseudocode and assembly language.

- Sedgewick, Robert. **Algorithms in C, Parts 1-4: Fundamentals, Data Structures, Sorting, Searching, Third Edition.** Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley Professional, 1997
Not surprisingly, this book covers data structures, sorting, and searching.

## Reference Books ##

- Harbison, Samuel P. and Steele, Guy L. **C: A Reference Manual, Fifth Edition**. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2002.
This reference manual presents the rules of the C language and describes most of the standard library functions. It incorporates discussion of C99 and provides many examples.

- Plauger, P.J. **The Standard C Library**. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1992.
This large reference manual describes the standard library functions, with more explanation than you would find in a typical compiler manual.
- The International C Standard . ISO/IEC 9899:2011
At the time of this writing, the standard is available as a $285 electronic download from www.ansi.org and as a €238 download from the IEC. Do not expect to learn C from this document because it is not intended as a tutorial. Here is a representative sentence: “If more than one declaration of a particular identifier is visible at any point in a translation unit, the syntactic context disambiguates uses that refer to different entities.”

## C++ Books ##
- Prata, Stephen. **C++ Primer Plus, Sixth Edition**. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Addison-Wesley, 2012.
This book introduces you to the C++ language (the C++11 standard) and to the philosophy of object-oriented programming.
- Stroustrup, Bjarne. **The C++ Programming Language, Fourth Edition.** Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 2013.
This book, by the creator of C++, presents the C++11 standard.
