I walk in the sun
And I start to feel that way
Joy in my heart
As I hear the children play

CHORUS:
This is the sound of summer
And it will chase your cares away
This is the sound of summer
So make the most of every beautiful day

Hot crazy nights
Giving my love to you
Under the moon
Tell me you feel it too

(chorus)

The water is blue
I feel the ocean spray
When I'm with you
It's a love holiday

(chorus 2x)

This is the sound of summer
This is the sound of summer
This is the sound of summer
This is the sound of summer
