Baby, let me follow you down, baby let me follow you down
Well, I'll do anything in this God-almighty world
If you just let me follow you down

I'll buy you a diamond ring, I'll buy you a wedding gown
Well, I'll do anything in this God-almighty world
If you just let me follow you down

Can I come home with you, baby can I come home with you
Well, I'll do anything in this God-almighty world
If you just let me come home with you

I'll buy you a broken twine, honey, just for you to climb
Yes I'll do anything in this God-almighty world
If you just once drive me out of my mind

I'll buy you a serpent skirt, I'll buy you a velvet shirt
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-almighty world
If you just don't make me hurt

Baby let me follow you down, baby let me follow you down
Well I'll do anything in this God-almighty world
If you just let me follow you down

Baby let me follow you down, baby let me follow you down
Well, I'll do anything in this God-almighty world
If you just let me follow you down
